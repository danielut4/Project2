# Resons for Development
Although there are quite a few note taking-like apps already available, they leave somehting to be desired for certain projects. For world building, event planning, and larger projects these apps lack the customization and pathway planning to fill this niche properly. We wanted to make an application that was simple enough to encourage regular use, without getting bogged down with trying to include every possible type of media.

Flexibility and Accessibility. Since it operates in the browser, users can access their ‘books’, or notes, from a variety of platforms.
